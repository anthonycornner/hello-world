# hello-world
### My name is Anthony Cornner, I'm a first year student at IvyTech Community College following a degree path for Software Development.
###### In my free time, I enojy coding small projects, creating music, and skateboarding. Follow me on my journey to becoming a Software Engineer. I'll see you at the end of it all, when I've finally landed that first position as a Software Eng./Software Dev.
